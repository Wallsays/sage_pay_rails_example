# Sage Pay Rails Example

This is an example application to demonstrate (and in some ways to guide the
development of) the [sage_pay](http://github.com/mathie/sage_pay) gem I'm
building to interface with Sage Pay's server interface.

You can find a live instance here:
<https://sage-pay-rails-example.heroku.com/>. It will guide you through the
Simulator interface, allowing you to pass all kinds of horrible errors back to
the app and torture it to see what happens. Hopefully, it works. :-)
